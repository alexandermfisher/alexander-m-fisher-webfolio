                            <h2>background</h2>
                            <p>So, a bit about my backgorund – I'm originally from Preston, UK, but I spent a good chunk of my childhood basking in the sun in Brisbane, Australia. 
                                Yep, that's right, sunny beaches and endless bbqs were the norm for me. Oh, and let's not forget my passion for the Brisbane Roar - the local football team. </p>
                            <p>Back in the UK since 2017, I've called Preston, Cardiff, and Abergavenny home before completing my BEng in Engineering Mathematics in the vibrant city of Bristol. 
                                Post Covid I gaining my PGCE and QTS and taught secondary school mathematics in local secondary schools based in Preston.</p> 
                            <p>Fast forward to today, and I'm knee-deep in my MSc in Computer Science here in Bristol. It's been quite the journey, but hey, life's all about the adventure, right?</p>

                            <h2>experience</h2>                                
                            <p>
                            I undertook my undergraduate degree at the University of Bristol for which I achieved a
                            first-class honours degree in Engineering Mathematics. I found my time studying in
                            Bristol extremely rewarding both personally and academically. During my time in
                            Bristol, I forged positive relationships within the engineering cohort, as well as in the
                            wider student community. I played an integral part in the Pool and Snooker society and
                            served on the committee as Snooker Captain. By overcoming both personal and
                            academic challenges while studying in Bristol I have demonstrated my aptitude and
                            ability to succeed in higher academic study, as well as my ability to show determination
                            and resilience.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            I have a strong mathematical background having studied a range of mathematics
                            modules, including discrete mathematics which I provide a strong basis for
                            computer science. My biggest achievement while at Bristol was completing
                            my final exams remotely during a global pandemic. This took a display of high levels of
                            determination, motivation, and flexibility. To complete my Control 3 assessment, I learnt
                            a new program Simulink in a limited amount of time. This I feel epitomises study and
                            life in the computing world which is characterised by the constant need to learn and
                            keep up to date with emerging technologies.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Since graduating from Bristol my interest in computer science has continued to grow.
                            The main outlet for this has been the vast wealth of online resources and courses
                            available online. I firstly completed a Data Science Specialisation (MOOC) course in
                            which I was exposed to the various tools and processes needed throughout an entire
                            data science pipeline. I then proceeded to engage in the various strands of CS50’s online
                            courses, which more specifically relate to computer science and programming. While
                            exploring these I really fostered my interest in programming and would characterise
                            myself at this point as being ‘hooked.’ I learnt the basics of programming, data
                            structures, and algorithms. Overall, by exploring these various resources I have planted
                            a strong passion in programming, as well as developed my ability to problem solve and
                            think algorithmically. Previously I have worked remotely as a Data Analyst and Software Developer for a start-
                            up company Efomics Ltd. This role focused on online ordering and epos software. As
                            this work was remote, I displayed high levels of motivation and organisation, as well as
                            an ability to communicate clearly. This experience was invaluable in giving me an
                            opportunity to work in a computing related role and has consolidated my passion to
                            work in this industry. My main achievement was implementing a document categorizer
                            in python using skills acquired while undertaking CS50’s Artificial Intelligence (MOOC)
                            course. This role was challenging in many aspects due to my limited experience in
                            programming, as well as unfamiliarity with the technologies they used. I strongly believe
                            as such further training would be highly beneficial and aid my ability to succeed in
                            similar roles in the future.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Previously I have worked on long term supply for a local school as a mathematics teacher.
                            Teaching has provided me with a contrast to the area of engineering/computing and
                            has exposed me to a different set of challenges. The time I spent both training and
                            working in the field has been productive and has helped me enhance my interpersonal
                            skills and communication skills immeasurably. Teaching demands a strong work ethic
                            and high levels of professionalism. I have developed a range of transferable skills that I
                            will take with me to any future endeavour. I am comfortable at public speaking and am
                            an active participant when working in a team environment.
